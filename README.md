## How do I approach designing software?

* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
* The new design skills I have acquired from this project include understanding requirements and translating those requirements from a real world image into a 3 dimensional imaginary space. Learning OpenGL has allowed me to understand the process for sending data from the CPU to the GPU and generating valid data structures and buffers to properly generate and render 3D graphics in an engine. Learning how to structure my programs to be smooth and efficient was especially important, and designing proper data structures to store all render data and objects was crucial.

* What design process did you follow for your project work?
* I looked to modularize as many aspects of my application possible, in order to increase the efficiency of the 3D application. I applied object oriented concepts for creating classes and structures for my objects and creating their own constructors along with their own class methods. This allowed me to generate as many objects as I needed to render in an effective manner.

* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
* I am looking forward to applying these techniques and approaches in a future position which may require the use of understanding graphics and UI design. It's important to understand the principles behind how 3D renders are created and the process that's involved for generating the image and interaction aspects of the application. I would like to use these skills to potentially create my own 3D games along with professional work involved in graphics.

## How do I approach developing programs?

* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
* New development strategies included getting the core aspects of the application to function first and setup efficiency. It was important when developing a new project or assignment to keep a consistent workspace and generate boilerplate code to effectively get up and running. I made sure to design the different aspects of the application based on their flow in the graphics pipeline, which included first initializing all OpenGL values and libraries, generating a window for displaying the render, creating a render loop for OpenGL visuals, and finally creating my assets. The assets involved generating textures, objects, animations, etc.

* How did iteration factor into your development?
* Iteration was important to understand in the project, especially when developing a new object or item in the scene. Understanding what occurs in OpenGL when displaying an object was important for displaying a camera object properly and calculating proper angles for perspective. It was also necessary to begin with a basic object and it's data (physical x,y,z points) and allocate that memory into a buffer object, which then we needed to send the physical data to the buffer in a specific formatted offset, and finally sent directly to the GPU. Once at the GPU we were able to render the data and run the application using specific OpenGL callbacks. This was an important iterative process for each rendered object in the scene.

* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
* My approach began with a very primitive boilerplate style, generating objects on their own without data structures. Once I moved on to more advanced objects in which the coordinates were generated through functions I began modularizing my code with structs and classes for both the objects and their respective shaders. I also modularized all the callbacks for the data (Vertex Buffer Objects and Element Buffer Objects, Shader Objects).

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
* Applying the knowledge and skills gained from this class in future courses will greatly help when designing UI or front end aspects to applications along with animations, since they can be written in WebGL. Understanding the graphics concepts and principles of a full application is important to general application design and efficiency. It's important to have experience with managing a project and keeping things consistent and organized throughout development.

* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
* Applying the knowledge and skills of the graphics pipeline, the data structures and process involved in sending data from the CPU and GPU along with the concepts of shaders can greatly help with landing a career in computer graphics, 3D engine engineering or any standard in electronic graphic design. This could be very useful for applying in a WebGL position in which I would apply OpenGL concepts using web technologies and frameworks. The same can be said for other graphics libraries and concepts which can be parallel.
